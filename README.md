# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Dataset
## Overview
The Breast Cancer Diagnosis dataset contains features related to breast cancer diagnosis based on various cellular attributes. 
The dataset includes measurements of cellular characteristics and their associated classification, which is used to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for each record
clump_thickness: Thickness of the clump of cells (scale from 1 to 10)
size_uniformity: Uniformity of cell sizes (scale from 1 to 10)
shape_uniformity: Uniformity of cell shapes (scale from 1 to 10)
marginal_adhesion: Adhesion of cells at the margins (scale from 1 to 10)
epithelial_size: Size of the epithelial cells (scale from 1 to 10)
bare_nucleoli: Number of bare nuclei (scale from 1 to 10)
bland_chromatin: Chromatin texture (scale from 1 to 10)
normal_nucleoli: Number of normal nucleoli (scale from 1 to 10)
mitoses: Number of mitoses (scale from 1 to 10)
class: Diagnosis of the tumor (0 = malignant, 1 = benign)

## Data Source
This dataset is sourced from Kaggle. For more information, you can visit the Kaggle dataset page.

## Learning outcomes
This dataset is suitable for supervised learning tasks, particularly for classification models. It can be used to predict the class (malignant or benign) based on various cellular features. It can also be used for exploratory data analysis to understand the relationships between different features and their impact on diagnosis.
